        <h3>Payed asked a simple question - with education so expensive, what can we do to make it easy for parents to
            acquire and repay the loans they take for the betterment of their children?<br><br> Their offerings cater to
            the child from KG to PG with a zero collateral and zero deposit. For parents, the loan is a boon, but the
            interest is what concerns them. Banks in India usually take 1-3% of interest on loans and the repayment
            period is between 5-7 years.</h3>

                    care. The three characteristics of our tone of voice and language were: respectful, formal and
                    enthusiastic. The text should speak to the reader in the second person, like a friend who's passing
                    good advice. Throughout the website, we formed a conversational relationship with the user, where
                    they feel that Payed supports them, understands them, and is easy to use.</h3>

                credit check. This was arranged in a way so as to not overwhelm the parent. Throughout the process, we
                introduced pre-action cues such as 'please keep your passport ready' to inform and guide pleasantly.

                the user should not be overwhelmed with numbers and text, given that the numbers may be in large sums,
                and too much text can be frustrating.</h3>

                you needed to do was pay back Payed - they took care of everything else.</h3>

                promotional emails were initiated to urge parents to complete the process as Payed benefits them, and
                the transactional emails were utilised as a touch point to confirm actions taken.</h3>
