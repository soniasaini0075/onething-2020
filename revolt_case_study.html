            <h3>Revolt Motors was primed to disrupt the Indian automotive sector with a revolutionary pair of electric
                sportbikes. The existing competition was slow, unreliable, unpleasant, and took forever to charge up. By
                contrast, Revolt bikes were fast, beautiful, feature-packed, and came with swappable batteries allowing
                users to go from 0-100% charge in 60 seconds.<br><br> Along with the bikes, Revolt was also introducing
                an entire ecosystem based on constant internet connectivity and nation-wide "swap stations" that would
                carry fully-charged batteries for the bikes. Revolt users would rely heavily on a mobile app to interact
                with this ecosystem, which we were asked to envision, design and execute.</h3>

                mass-market - the millennial urban commuters who travelled mostly from home to work and back, earned
                less than 1 lakh a month and were focused on maximising value-for-money.</h3>

                <li>For most millennial bike owners, the look and feel of the product mattered to them the most.
                    Therefore, the app and the bike both had to offer them a visually “cool” aesthetic that they could
                    show off.</li>
                <br><br>
                <li>84% of electric vehicle owners mentioned “long charging time” in the top three issues they face with

                <br><br>

                mode, and range/battery level, as well as perform actions like starting the bike remotely, changing the

                        the
