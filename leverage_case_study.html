                    of having all the key information that is valuable to their users on their website, they would often
                    get enquiries on the phone from students asking for the same information.</h3>

                    the trust of its users. Since the number of competitors in this space is particularly high, it was
                    important to appear as a company that is trustworthy and an expert in this space.</h3>

            catering to, viz, school students, college students, and working professionals. Here’s what we discovered.

                    less
                    than 2 minutes. The user has to input if he/she is a student in school, student in university or a
                    working professional. Post which, the tool asks for some exam scores, last education and work
                    experience. Based on these data points, it generates a list of universities where the student would
                    be a
                    good fit. Since a lot of students who reach out to Leverage Edu do not know which universities they

                    identify content catered for them easily. We used a simple sans serif font “Montserrat” which comes
                    in
                    various font weights that helped us achieve the visual hierarchy we wanted. Since the website was

                    text
                    heavy, we used a lot of detailed illustrations that gave the eye a break from all the text. Each
                    illustration was designed specific to the content in that section and followed a flat style. Apart
                    from
                    using grayscale for the text, we used pastel colors for the illustrations to increase the contrast
