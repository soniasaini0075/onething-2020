        <h3>Supr Daily started as a Milk Subscription and reinvented the product to become a ‘Micro-Delivery’ Service
            that took care of all grocery needs. The product leverages the power of the milk railroad to deliver eggs,
            bread, fruits, veggies, and other groceries to the user’s doorstep. Order by 11pm, Get it by 7am. Supr Daily
            delivers your daily needs to your doorstep hassle-free.<br><br> Employed women and home makers want to
            provide fresh wholesome meals to the entire family. But, with a fridge full of stale groceries and a no-show
            from the milkman, it gets extremely difficult. This affects lakhs of Indian households increasing the need
            to hoard perishables which also increases wastage of food in the system overall. The product aims at solving
            this issue.</h3>
